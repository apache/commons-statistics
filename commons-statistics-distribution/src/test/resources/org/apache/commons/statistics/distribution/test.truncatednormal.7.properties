# Test a narrow truncation range.
# Note:
# This is a very narrow truncation.
# The normalised value for the bound [(lower-u)/sd, (upper-u)/sd] is:
# [-1.0101010039621505E-8, 1.0101010129336497E-8]
# Here exp(-0.5*x*x) == 1 and the computation loses precision and variance -> 0

parameters = 7.1, 9.9, 7.0999999, 7.1000001

# Limited by the computation of variance (which -> 0). Solved with absolute tolerance.
# Also note that the relative error is lowered to pass the tests for logpdf, cdf and sf.

# scipy computes mean = 7.0999999999999996, var = 1.1358413484763297e-07 (too high)

# Computed using 128-bit quad precision test c++ program using Boost erf for the
# error function with variations on the computation creates values:
