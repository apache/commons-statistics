      <p>
        Commons Statistics provides a framework and implementations for commonly used
        probability distributions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Continuous univariate distributions are represented by the
        <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/statistics/distribution/ContinuousDistribution.html">ContinuousDistribution</a>
        interface.  Discrete distributions implement
        <a href="apidocs/org/apache/commons/statistics/distribution/DiscreteDistribution.html">DiscreteDistribution</a>
        (values must be mapped to integers).
      </p>

      <p>
        Example:
      </p>

<source class="prettyprint">import org.apache.commons.statistics.distribution.TDistribution;

double degreesOfFreedom = 29;
TDistribution t = TDistribution.of(degreesOfFreedom);
double lowerTail = t.cumulativeProbability(-2.656);   // P(T(29) &lt;= -2.656)
double upperTail = t.survivalProbability(2.75);       // P(T(29) &gt;= 2.75)
</source>
