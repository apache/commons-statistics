      <p>
        Apache Commons Statistics provides statistical hypothesis testing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Example:
      </p>

<source class="prettyprint">import org.apache.commons.statistics.inference.ChiSquaredTest;

double[] expected = ...
long[] observed = ...
double alpha = 1e-3;

// Fail if we can *reject* the null hypothesis with confidence (1 - alpha)
// that the observed match the expected
if (ChiSquareTest.withDefaults().test(expected, observed).reject(alpha)) {
    // Not significant ...
}
