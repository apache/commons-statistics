          The distributions package provides a framework and implementations for some commonly used
          probability distributions. Continuous univariate distributions are represented by implementations of
          the <a href="../commons-statistics-distribution/apidocs/org/apache/commons/statistics/distribution/ContinuousDistribution.html">ContinuousDistribution</a>
          interface.  Discrete distributions implement
          <a href="../commons-statistics-distribution/apidocs/org/apache/commons/statistics/distribution/DiscreteDistribution.html">DiscreteDistribution</a>
          (values must be mapped to integers).
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="1.2 API" href="distributions">
        <p>
          The distribution framework provides the means to compute probability density,
          probability mass and cumulative probability functions for several well-known
          discrete (integer-valued) and continuous probability distributions.
          The API also allows for the computation of inverse cumulative probabilities
          and sampling from distributions.
        </p>
        <p>
          For an instance <code>f</code> of a distribution <code>F</code>,
          and a domain value, <code>x</code>, <code>f.cumulativeProbability(x)</code>
          computes <code>P(X &lt;= x)</code> where <code>X</code> is a random variable distributed
          as <code>F</code>.
          For <a href="../commons-statistics-distribution/apidocs/org/apache/commons/statistics/distribution/DiscreteDistribution.html">discrete</a>
          <code>F</code>, the probability mass function is given by <code>f.probability(x)</code>.
          For <a href="../commons-statistics-distribution/apidocs/org/apache/commons/statistics/distribution/ContinuousDistribution.html">continuous</a>
          <code>F</code>, the probability density function is given by <code>f.density(x)</code>.
          Continuous distributions also implement <code>f.probability(x1, x2)</code> for computing
          <code>P(x1 &lt;= X &lt;= x2)</code>.
        </p>
<source class="prettyprint">TDistribution t = TDistribution.of(29);
double lowerTail = t.cumulativeProbability(-2.656);   // P(T(29) &lt;= -2.656)
double upperTail = t.survivalProbability(2.75);       // P(T(29) &gt;= 2.75)</source>
        <p>
          All distributions implement a <code>createSampler(UniformRandomProvider rng)</code>
          method to support random sampling from the distribution, where <code>UniformRandomProvider</code>
          is an interface defined in <a href="https://commons.apache.org/rng">Commons RNG</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inverse distribution functions can be computed using the
          <code>inverseCumulativeProbability</code> methods.  For continuous <code>f</code>
          and <code>p</code> a probability, <code>f.inverseCumulativeProbability(p)</code> returns
          <ul>
            <li><code>inf{x in R | P(X &le; x) &ge; p} for 0 &lt; p &lt; 1},</code></li>
            <li><code>inf{x in R | P(X &le; x) &gt; 0} for p = 0}.</code></li>
          </ul>
          where <code>X</code> is distributed as <code>F</code>.<br/>
          For discrete <code>F</code>, the definition is the same, with <code>Z</code> (the integers)
          in place of <code>R</code> (but note that, in the discrete case, the &ge; in the definition
          can make a difference when <code>p</code> is an attained value of the distribution).
