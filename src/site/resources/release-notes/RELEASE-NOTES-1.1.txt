                            Version 1.1
                           Release Notes


INTRODUCTION:

This document contains the release notes for the 1.1 version of Apache Commons Statistics.

The Apache Commons Statistics project provides tools for statistics.

Adds ranking, inference, descriptive and bom modules.

Contains the following modules:

  commons-statistics-descriptive
  commons-statistics-distribution
  commons-statistics-inference
  commons-statistics-ranking
  commons-statistics-bom

Requires Java 8.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o STATISTICS-88:   "LogUniformDistribution": Add a log uniform distribution.
o STATISTICS-87:   "FoldedNormalDistribution": Add a folded normal distribution implementation with
                   specialized support for a half-normal distribution.
o STATISTICS-85:   Add a quantile and median implementation.
o STATISTICS-81:   Add descriptive statistics for integer types. These allow improved accuracy and
                   performance for int and long data using an array or streams over using the
                   equivalent double implementation via primitive conversion.
o STATISTICS-71:   Add commons-statistics-descriptive module for implementations of univariate
                   statistics. Contains base interfaces for statistics and implementations for
                   individual statistics (e.g. Min, Max, Sum, Mean, Variance) and combinations of
                   statistics. Thanks to Anirudh Joshi, Alex Herbert.
o STATISTICS-69:   "UncoditionedExactTest": Add an unconditioned exact test for 2x2 contingency
                   tables.
o STATISTICS-70:   "HypergeometricDistribution": Improve the summation used for the cumulative
                   probability functions.
o STATISTICS-66:   Add a Bill of Materials (BOM) to aid in dependency management when referencing
                   multiple Apache Commons Statistics artifacts. The BOM should be used to ensure
                   all imported artifacts are compatible.
o STATISTICS-64:   "FisherExactTest": Add Fisher's exact test for 2x2 contingency tables.
o STATISTICS-62:   Add a commons-statistics-inference module for hypothesis testing. This ports and
                   updates functionality in org.apache.commons.math4.stat.inference including new
                   support for one-sided hypothesis testing.
o STATISTICS-63:   Add a commons-statistics-ranking module for rank transformations. This ports and
                   updates functionality in org.apache.commons.math4.stat.ranking.
